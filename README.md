# Small-COBOL-Assignment
Perhaps small isn't the best word to describe this project! This was from CSC407, Concepts of Programming Languages, at NKU.

# Assignment
You can view the assignment prompt [here](https://github.com/lcombs15/Small-COBOL-Assignment/blob/master/assignment.pdf).

# Running &amp; Compiling
We used a Linux compiler, cobc, which is more formally called open-COBOL or [GnuCobol](http://open-cobol.sourceforge.net/).

Run this command to compile this project:
> cobc -free -x -o MAIN-EXE main.cbl

Finally, to execute the code, run MAIN-EXE. If you are are on a Linux machine:
> ./MAIN-EXE
